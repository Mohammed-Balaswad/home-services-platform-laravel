An integrated digital solution designed to bridge the gap between local technicians and households in **Al-Mukalla, Yemen**. This platform streamlines the process of booking, managing, and evaluating home services through a robust three-tier architecture.

## 📌 Project Overview
In my local community, finding trusted technicians (plumbers, electricians, etc.) is often a manual and fragmented process. This project was developed to provide a **centralized, transparent, and user-friendly** marketplace where service providers and clients can interact efficiently.
